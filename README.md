## Simplication Standards
I myself enjoy having commands and tools being at max 3 characters long. Of course the file format can have some liberty with length but the inital filename should be at most 3 characters long. Or if not have there be a form of ils (index listing) that can simplify the writing of tedious or verbosious names. It is late and I really do feel like writing pretenciously in order to give myself a sense of importance.

1. filenames at max 3 characters.
2. have a form of index listing
3. open source the information

## Names
cig <cody index get (path)>
cil <cody index list

The basics of language is thought to be the symbols and words relating to the menaings regarding who, what, where, why, and how.
